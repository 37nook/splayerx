6,890 --> 00:00:09.690
Kids,on my first day
as a college professor,

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.850
there re two things I
didn't know that I wish did.

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.050
The first thing was that your
mother was in that classroom.

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.330
The second thing?

5
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.580
Well,to explain tt, we have to go
back to the beginning of the summer,

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.280
when,after a ye of wrestling with
their feelings for each other,

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.220
Barney and Robin finally,well...

8
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.930
Lily,volume. Use your indoor "whoo."

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610
Sorry,whoo!

10
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.620
It's jt they kissed!
They're finally a couple.

11
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.420
Oh,my God,you guys! This
is our first double date!

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.480
First of millions! What if our
kids get married? Oh,I love this!

13
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.730
Yeah... Lily,listen.

14
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.580
Barney's awesome.

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.230
Ron's more than just awe
-"some."

16
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.100
She's awe-"quite a bit."
She's awe-"a whole darn lot."

17
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.250
Wait,what are you saying?

18
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.480
We're just not feeling it right now.

19
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.830
- But we'll totally still be friends.
- Oh,yeah.

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.120
Is it something I did?

21
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.980
- Oh,no,no,no, no,God,no.
- No,no,no.

22
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.630
- Lily,it's not you. It'ss.
- Yeah. It's us.

23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.290
You understand,right?

24
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.610
Sure,of course.

25
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.160
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.

26
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.610
We were gonna takecooking and we were
gonna go on camping trips together

27
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.780
and then we were gonna sit around telng funny stories
about our cooking lessons and our camping trips.

28
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.800
I know,I know.

29
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.510
So,has the boat sailed
onex tonight or...

30
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.040
After that,the summer
went by way too fast.

31
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.980
Until all of a sudden, it was the Friday
before my firsday as a college professor.

32
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.520
- Whoa,what's this?
- Oh,boy.

33
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.840
It's just a little
something that we got for you

34
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.180
that used to belong to my
favorite professor of all time.

35
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.790
A fedora.

36
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.690
I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!

37
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.410
That,my friend, is the Dinator 8000,

38
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.520
the best bullwhip on the
market, according to my whip guy.

39
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.220
Yeah,I have a whip guy.

40
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.020
You know what we should do? We should...

41
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.410
Finish ourrinks,go out in
the alley,and whip stuff.

42
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.370
God,you just get me.

43
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.050
Okay,I should get going. I got a date.

44
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.120
Oh,are you still seeing that guy?

45
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.030
Uh,even better, seeing him naked. What!

46
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.610
I should go,too.

47
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.620
I hooked up with this Chinese girl
last night, and I don't know,it's weird.

48
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.780
I already feel like seconds.

49
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.680
Okay,Ted,you got first whip!

50
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.230
All right.

51
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.130
Hey,dummy. What did tell
you about smoking in here?

52
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.610
Make him whip the habit!

53
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.290
I'so excited about this
whip! I got whip fever!

54
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.860
Just whip him,Ted! Don't
even aim! Just whip him!

55
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.620
I am so sorry.

56
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.120
No,it's just the whip's not a toy,Ted.

57
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.520
There's such a thing as
common sense,you know.

58
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.140
Hey,you can whip me if you want.

59
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.520
I will,some other time.

Mother Season05 Episode01</font>

63
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.170
So,how long has this been going on?

64
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.790
All summer.

65
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.240
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

66
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.310
You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend.

67
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.450
- Wow,no. Whoa,whoa,whoa,Lily.
- Girlfriend?

68
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.910
- Slow your roll there,Lilypad.
- Yeah,yeah.

69
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.340
You've been together
all summer. I dot get it.

70
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.020
Okay,it's like this.

71
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.380
After we kissed, we sat
down to have the talk.

72
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.800
We should figure out what this is.

73
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.980
Yes,we should. Or. Or...

74
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.680
Okay,now, we have to figure this out.

75
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.640
Yes,we do. Or. Or...

76
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.150
We kept trying to have the talk and
then we realized we hate the talk.

77
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.740
Yeah,the talk sucks.
You have to,like,talk.

78
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.160
And be all, "I don't know.
"It's not that I don't like you.

79
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.790
"It'sust that I haven't had a girlfriend "in a
really ng time. I hope it doesn't make you mad."

80
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.530
- Who needs it?
- You needs it.

81
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.610
Guys,you can't just keep hooking up and not at
least try and fire out what you mean to each other.

82
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.520
Yeah,we knew you would say that.
That's why we kept it a secret.

83
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.490
We,that and the fact that
elaborate lies really turn us on.

84
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.710
No,no,no. No.

85
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.400
You need tdefine the relationship.
You ne to have the talk.

86
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.550
Or. Or.

87
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.460
I know what you're all thinking.

88
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.440
"Who's this cool peer of
mine up in front the class?"

89
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.660
Well,I know the board says "Professor
Mosby," but to you I'm Ted,huh?

90
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.920
Question. Awesome. Hit it.

91
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.820
Yeah,here's my question. "Ted,"
who the hell do you think you are?

92
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.730
Yeah,"Ted." We're supposed to learn
from you? You failed as an architect.

93
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.270
Well...

94
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.090
And if you're a professor,
where's your h and your whip?

95
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.230
They're at home.

96
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.940
And where are your pants?

97
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.430
Oh,God. Barney,it was
awful. I was teaching...

98
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.940
Shh,Ted,now's not a good time.
Whe do you keep your condoms?

99
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.930
******

100
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.930
ay,look,mistake #1 was
taking that girl's question.

101
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.190
You don't ta questions on the
first day. It shows weakness.

102
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.660
Mist ake #2 was you should've hit that.

103
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.990
Dude,your pants were already off, u had a
classroom full of people to cheer you on,

104
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.550
and you n't knock her
up 'cause it's a dream.

105
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.190
Class dismissed.

106
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.460
Mist ake #3,dude,where was the hat?

107
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.960
Because if y're not going to
wear it, I'm taking it back.

108
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.460
I think what Barney's saying is
that definitions are important.

109
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.480
You're their teacher, not their friend.

110
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.110
- Exactly.
- ****nobody's happy.

111
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.320
Amen.

112
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.240
- You have to ma things clear.
- Run tell dat.

113
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.130
- Define the relationship.
- Yes! No!

114
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.340
Lily,private convo time.

115
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.690
Lily,can't you just let us be happy?

116
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.940
You're notappy.

117
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.900
You just think you're happy
because you feel happy.

118
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.570
- And that's not happy?
- Of course not.

119
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.490
You and Robin need to have the talk.

120
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.230
Why? Give me one good reason.

121
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.000
- I'll give you 20...
- Wow,you can't even think of one.

122
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.990
Headlights. Deer.

123
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.300
Lily,for the last time, things with me and
Robin are as good as they can possibly be.

124
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.120
Oh,hey,look,Brad's here.

125
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.840
I've got two tickets to the
Rangers/Canucksame tomorrow night.

126
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.650
I know you're a hockey
fan, so I was tnking...

127
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.290
What do I have to do?
Put a gun to your head?

128
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.370
- Buy you a six ck?
- Oh,come on,Brad,that's...

129
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.880
Wow,there's really six of them.

130
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.910
- Uh,t,uh,I can't.
- Why not? You have a boyfriend?

131
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.870
- No. No,no boyfriend.
- Great! It's a date.

132
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.200
- Hey,Barn.
- Hey,Br...

133
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.260
********

134
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.260
***nht,Robin and Brad
went to a hockey game.

135
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.980
You're probably wondering
why I've been quiet all night.

136
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.900
Damn it,Hordichuk!You miss
another gimme like that,

137
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.440
I'm gonna come down there and put a
slapper right up ur beerhole! Come on!

138
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.260
Not really.

139
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.060
The truth is, I-I feel kind
of weird being out with you.

140
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.790
Oh,man. Is this the talk?

141
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.850
- What?
- No,this is od.

142
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.520
Let's get it all out of the way.

143
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.760
Robin,I'm looking for something serious.

144
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.250
No,Brad,no,it's...

145
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.050
But before we go any further, you should
know something about my stuff below the belt.

146
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.510
I was born a little different.

147
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.360
God,no,uh, Brad,no,um...

148
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.620
- This iabout me and Barney.
- You and Barn...

149
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.340
Oh,oh,so you, you guys are...

150
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.800
Well,we-we-we don't know what we are.
I mean,my heart says "leap into it."

151
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.210
My brain says "it's a bad idea."

152
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.300
Sounds like you guys
need to have the talk.

153
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.090
We're not gonna have the talk!

154
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.200
Would you just have the talk,okay?

155
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.070
It's a five-minute conversation, and then
you get to have sex afterwards. It's great!

156
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.560
Back me up,Ted.

157
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.000
- I don't think the talk is necessary.
- What?

158
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.260
Thank you,Ted.

159
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.900
- Because Robin is already his girlfriend.
- What?

160
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.680
MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...

161
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.050
How do you keep a girl from
becoming your girlfrien Simple:

162
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.960
the rules for girls are the same
as the rulesfor gremlin "Gremlins"?

163
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.870
Gremlins.

164
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.380
*******never get them wet.

165
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.010
In otherords,don't let her
take a shower at your place.

166
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.290
******keep them
away from sunlight--

167
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.230
i.e.don't ever see them during the day.

168
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.980
And rule # never feed
them after midnight.

169
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.790
Meaning she doesn't sleep over and
you don't have breakfast with her ever.

170
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.220
What about brunch? Is brunch cool?

171
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.770
No,Ted. unch is not cool.

172
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.500
Ok,new topic. How do I pick a tie?

173
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.180
mple: remember in the movie Predator...

174
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.930
I've done all three of
those things with Robin.

175
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.470
Is she my girlfriend?

176
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.020
Just once,wish you guys
would call me on Tuxedo Night.

177
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:45.710
Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker
up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!

178
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.190
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

179
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.700
Okayhow about this?

180
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.830
If you kiss me and you feel bad about
it, you're meant to be with Barney.

181
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.020
Why not? Lay it on me.

182
00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.330
Kiss!

183
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.720
Kiss!

184
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.420
Hey,Bd.

185
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.770
Brad,we can't fight like this all night!

186
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.810
We both got some good shots
in. Let's call a truce!

187
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.610
It's oy,dude.

188
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.660
I shouldn't go kissing
some other guy's girlfriend.

189
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.930
Whoa,whoa,whoa,
whoa,girlfriend? He come on.

190
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.130
- That's putting it a bit strongly.
- A bit strongly. She's no *******

191
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.750
A gifriend's a bit much,Brad,okay?

192
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.060
Okay,seriously. We're at the
point of physical violence.

193
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.250
Now,will you ease have the talk?

194
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.650
Because of that? Come on. That's thing.

195
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.780
I'm always punching guys.

196
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.410
Girls-- I'll punch
a baby. I don't care.

197
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.020
Finally,my first clas had
arrived. For real this time.

198
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.200
I knew I had to make a strong iression.

199
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.890
I had thought of everything. Except...

200
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.290
Wait. Does professor have one
"F" or two? Oh,my God. Oh,my God.

201
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.730
Professor. Pro-fess-or.
They're all starg at me.

202
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.450
Professor. Uh,I don't
know. Ju do something!

203
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.080
Two "F's." That looks
right. I think that's right.

204
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.680
Hey,sorry I went little
too far last night.

205
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.360
Oh,look,we've been over this. Unless I
say "fl gelhorn," you haven't gone too far.

206
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.320
No,meant punching Brad.

207
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.400
Oh,right. Look, don't even
worry about it. It's...

208
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.480
God. The doorknob's broken
off. We're locked in here.

209
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.970
Did,did you do this?

210
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.000
- No.
- Fl gelhorn. Did you do this?

211
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.030
No.

212
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.450
Ted? Ted,are you out there?

213
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.790
Ted's not here,Robin.

214
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.220
Lily,let us out of here.

215
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.560
I'd be glad to.

216
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.410
Just as soon as you and
Barney have the talk.

217
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.100
Lily! Co on. Let us out!

218
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:08.860
No. Sit down, define the relationship, write
down that definition on a piece of paper,

219
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.000
slip it under the door, and if
I like what I read, you can go.

220
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.690
We are not having the talk!

221
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.340
Then you'll die in there.

222
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.070
You're gonna lock us in
here? Well,guess what?

223
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.760
Maybe we'll spend the
whole day having sex!

224
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.870
Well,guess at?

225
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.120
I brought Marshall with me,
so maybe we'll do the same.

226
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.880
Hey,guys.

227
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:35.300
I stilhadn't decided what kind of professor
I wanted to be-- authoritative or cool guy.

228
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.160
I thought I would decide in the moment.

229
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.630
**********

230
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.850
Goodorning. 'Sup,dudes? Silence!

231
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.210
This is Architecture
101. I am Professor Mosby.

232
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.880
But you can call me Ted.

233
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.660
Professor Mosby. T-Dawg.

234
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.620
Do not call me T-Dawg.

235
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.180
Ner take questions on the
first day. It shows weakness.

236
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.180
Also, don't look right here.

237
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.050
Okay,good luck. Byesies.

238
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.860
This was it: my crossroads moment.

239
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.910
What kind of professor was
I gonna be I had to decide.

240
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.440
Please save all your qstions until the
end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...

241
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.530
Professor Mosby d arrived.

242
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.970
Of course,if I had taken
that girl's question--

243
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.560
who,by the way,was not your
mo Your mom was sitting...

244
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.640
Wait,let me finish this story al quick.

245
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.880
Here's what that girl wod have said.

246
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.740
I'm sorry to bother you,Professor
Mo but this isn't Architecture 101.

247
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.700
This is Economics 305.

248
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.940
You're in the wrong classroom.

249
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.270
Yes,I was in the wrong classroom.

250
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.520
And thus began the most
humiliating ven minutesof my life.

251
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.450
Here's your
ink-about-it for the day.

252
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.220
Every single person in this
room is already an architect.

253
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.520
Architt?

254
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.170
"We're just hanging out."

255
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.700
Just hanging out?

256
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.030
- Not good enough.
- Not good enough!

257
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:26.410
Can anyone here tell me what
this class is really all about?

258
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.430
Economics?

259
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.240
No. No,no. Don't ugh. He's
not... He's not entirely wrong.

260
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:38.160
An architect must be
economical in his use of space,

261
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.210
so,well done.

262
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:46.550
Looks like somne's
building towards an A,huh?

263
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.370
"We're seeing where things are going."

264
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:56.310
I'll tell you where things
aren't ing-- out of that bedroom.

265
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.260
- Not good enough.
- Not good eugh!

266
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.440
You-- why do you want
to be an architect?

267
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.580
I don't want to be an architect.

268
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.740
Yes. Yes,exactly.

269
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.820
It-It's not something you want to be.

270
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.120
It's something you need to be.

271
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.590
You dot have a choice,right?

272
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.750
None of you has a choice. No questions!

273
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.640
"We're Barnman and Robin."

274
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.550
Oh,come on,you got to admit,
that's kind of fun,Lily.

275
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.950
Not good enough.

276
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.170
Not good enough!

277
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.830
So if any of you have even the slightest
inclination to do anything with your life

278
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.650
other than become an archite,

279
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.730
you're wasting my time and yours.

280
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.690
There's the door You can go.

281
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.620
*******

282
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.200
Wait,wait,wait. Don't-Don't all leave!

283
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.590
Architecture's fun! Look!
I brought a hacky sack!

284
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.190
SorrI'm late,everyone.

285
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.360
My name is Professor Calzonetti.
This is Economics 305.

286
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.760
You may return to your seats.

287
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.700
Uh,sorry,sir. This
is,uh,Architecture 101.

288
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.460
Who invited their dad,right?

289
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.430
Young man, for the last 28 years,

290
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.610
Economics 305 has been taught
right here inuilding 14,room 7.

291
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.930
Uh,yeah.

292
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.380
Buddy,I'm sure 200 architecture students
antheir professor all got the room wrong.

293
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.380
T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room,bro.

294
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.350
****** Sorry. Comg through.

295
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.120
Excuse me.

296
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.730
20 minutes late on your first day?

297
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.680
That's rough.

298
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.600
Yeah,but here's the funny thing.

299
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.800
By that point, I didn't have time to think
about what kind of teacher I was going to be.

300
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.050
I just got up there and
talked about architecture.

301
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.320
And it was kind of great.

302
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.740
- That's awesome,Ted.
- Yeah. Congratulations,buddy.

303
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.630
- Thanks.
- Nice job,Ted.

304
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.610
Hey,Ted,door five!

305
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.180
- Were you there?
- Yeah,I got you, buddy.

306
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.030
They still haven't had the talk,huh?

307
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.910
I think I know how to speed things up

308
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.320
Oh,not cool!

309
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.320
Pancakes,fresh bacon.

310
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.160
It is so yummy.

311
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.620
Uh,dude, I'm starving. Let's...

312
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.350
Let's just have the
stupid talk. Come on.

313
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.260
Fine.

314
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.970
But how do these this
even work? What do we say?

315
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.310
********

316
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.040
Oh,my God, that sounds so cheesy.

317
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.210
- I know,right?
- Totally.

318
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.670
But,um, where-where do you
see this relationship going?

319
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.340
I don't know.

320
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.750
I mean, it's not like I don't like you.

321
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.940
I just haven't had a
girlfriend for a long time.

322
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.010
I hope that doesn't make you mad.

323
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.920
Mad? I feel the same way.
I suck at relationshs.

324
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.010
I mean, exceptith Ted.

325
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.650
Man,he really got it right.

326
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.150
I know it's a clich? but he
really ruined me for other men.

327
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.380
Of course,I wasn't in the
room for this conversation,

328
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.440
but I have to imagine bin
said something like that.

329
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.860
Maybe we should go back
to being jt friends.

330
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.740
Maybe.

331
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.990
But,um, I don't want to stop having sex.

332
00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.020
Oh,good. Me,neither.

333
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.720
- Yeah. Friends isn't gonna work.
- Nope.

334
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.120
Oh,we're not good at being friends. We're nogood
at being in a relationship. Wh are we good at?

335
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.290
I know something we're good at.

336
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.580
I don't know. If we're gonna do it
again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade,or...

337
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.120
No! No,t that. Lying.

338
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.710
Oy,think about it. We spent the whole
summer lying about being just friends.

339
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.860
Why not just keep lying?

340
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.450
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

341
00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.200
We sat down. We had the talk.

342
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.130
- Barney's my boyfriend now.
- And Robin's myirlfriend.

343
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.010
I know it sounds nuts,
but it feels good to say.

344
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:21.080
We're both afraid ofommitment, but,the fact
is, we also can't live without each other.

345
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.340
And if the alternative is not being together,
then it's worth taking this risk 'cause...

346
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.460
she's awesome.

347
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.210
And he's awesome. He lks nice in a suit.

348
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.670
She n handle her Scotch.

349
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.190
He's my boyfriend.

350
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.560
And she's my girlfriend.

351
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.200
Good enough!

352
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.210
She bought it.

353
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.750
Hook,line,and sinker. are good.

354
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.550

357

362

363
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:38.070
Oh,hello. Hello. Good

364
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.100
Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello.

365
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.530

366
00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.380
